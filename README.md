# SC-2015-Competition

Welcome to Silent Circle's 2015 Internship Competition. The format of the competition is as follows:

When the competition begins, the repo will be filled with folders containing challenge questions of varying difficulty. Each folder will have a specific topic and each challenge question will have a point-value assigned to it. The harder the question, the more points it will be worth.

The goal is to gain as many points as possible in the alotted amount of time. Points are gained by answering the question completely. Some questions (like some of the crypto questions) will by Capture-The-Flag format where there is a very specific answer that we are looking for. Others will require written responses and some may require a program as a response. If a question asks you to perform a specific task, make sure your response includes valid evidence that you have completed it succesfully (e.g. files, screenshots, outputs, etc.) Program responses will generally have a specific test which we will be testing with. There is no specific requirement on language choices, however it should be easy to run and a well-known language.

To submit your results send them packaged in a zip file to __________. The package should contain a folder for each section with either a file or folder (if the submission requires multiple files) for each challenge question.

If at anytime during the competition you have any questions, feel free to email ___________ and we will try to get back to you ASAP!

Good luck!
